/**
 * The sendcmpct message is defined as a message containing a 1-byte integer followed by a
 * 8-byte integer where pchCommand == "sendcmpct".
 *
 * The first integer SHALL be interpreted as a boolean (and MUST have a value of either 1 or 0)
 *
 * The second integer SHALL be interpreted as a little-endian version number.
 * Nodes sending a sendcmpct message MUST currently set this value to 1.
 *
 * Upon receipt of a "sendcmpct" message with the first and second integers set to 1,
 * the node SHOULD announce new blocks by sending a cmpctblock message.
 *
 * Upon receipt of a "sendcmpct" message with the first integer set to 0,
 * the node SHOULD NOT announce new blocks by sending a cmpctblock message,
 * but SHOULD announce new blocks by sending invs or headers, as defined by BIP130.
 *
 * Upon receipt of a "sendcmpct" message with the second integer set to something other than 1,
 * nodes MUST treat the peer as if they had not received the message (as it indicates the
 * peer will provide an unexpected encoding in cmpctblock, and/or other, messages).
 * This allows future versions to send duplicate sendcmpct messages with different versions
 * as a part of a version handshake for future versions.
 *
 * Nodes SHOULD check for a protocol version of >= 70014 before sending sendcmpct messages.
 *
 * Nodes MUST NOT send a request for a MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK object to a peer before having
 * received a sendcmpct message from that peer.
 *
 * This packet is only supported by protocol version >= 70014
