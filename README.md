# Resolving Architecture - Bitcoin Client - Java
Bitcoin Client as a Service

Provides an API as a Service for a local Bitcoin Core node via its RPC API.

Local Bitcoin instance should be configured to use local 1M5 proxy at best, local Tor proxy at least for inter-Bitcoin-node communications.

## Setup
Ensure contents of bitcoin.conf provided in project config folder are in the bitcoin.conf file located in the .bitcoin
directory within the bitcoin installation directory. This enables the JSON RPC.
